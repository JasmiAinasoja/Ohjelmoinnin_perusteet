# Make Python program to do the following:
# 1. Assign variable with string value: "John"
Name1 = "John"
# 2. Print the variable
print(Name1)
# 3. Assign second variable with another string value: "Harry"
Name2 = "Harry"
# 4. Print the second variable
print(Name2)
# 5. Make the program to print both names on the screen at the same row separated by space-character
print(Name1, Name2)
# 6. Make the program to print a string "is eating ice cream with" between the previously created variables.
print(Name1, "is eating ice cream with", Name2)
# 7. Make the program to print one more row to the screen which outputs following "Tom and Harry are friends". Use the existing variables to do so.
print(Name1, "and", Name2, "are friends")
